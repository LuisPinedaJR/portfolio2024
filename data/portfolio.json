    "aboutpara": "My journey started during MySpace years, I loved adding new pieces of code to my page and liked seeing the changes on the browser, however, I didn't know I could do that as a career. I have been studying web development on my own for about 3 years and completed task work such as Udemy courses, Code academy, etc. I joined Lambda School and my knowledge of computer science and software engineering accelerated and gave me the confidence to work for myself. Today, I currently am a Freelance ReachJS contractor always looking for challenging roles and projects. I am continuing my studies of tech, there is always something new to learn, currently studying design and data science.  Outside of coding, I like to use my hands to get crafty and paint, I am not picasso but it helps relieve stress and it is relaxing. I am a father to a one year old and I truly love being a father, including the changing diapers part. I also enjoy traveling and taking pictures of different architecture structures.",
